    title: Showjumping
    text: 'Unaffiliated showjumping has always been popular at Topthorn, and our
      Friday night showjumping evenings are often a first competition for local
      riders or a useful informal training show for young riders and/or
      horses.  Our regular Mini to Metre showjumping competitions offer smaller
      heights in the morning, up to 1m in the afternoon with more fillers. Our
      showjumping shows offer a friendly competition environment, giving an
      encouraging experience to horse and rider.'

      ranging from Prelim to Medium, with some shows extending to PSG. We also

Topthorn Arena is a friendly equestrian centre in the heart of Suffolk, easily accessible from every corner of East Anglia. We welcome both professional and amateur riders, pony clubs, riding associations and coaches.Our aim is to encourage all levels of riding by providing a range of training opportunities and competition experiences.

We are an affiliated British Dressage venue with regular unaffiliated showjumping and dressage shows, as well as a full programme of popular clinics and arena hire days.

Both the indoor and outdoor arenas have been recently resurfaced by Equestrian Surfaces and the site benefits from plenty of parking and a viewing area.

Topthorn reserves the right to spot-check horse passports to check for up to date vaccinations and asks for horses to have had six month boosters.
