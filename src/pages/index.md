      text: "Unaffiliated showjumping has always been popular at Topthorn, and our
        Friday night showjumping evenings are often a first competition for
        local riders or a useful informal training show for young riders and/or
        horses.  Our regular Mini to Metre showjumping competitions offer
        smaller heights in the morning, up to 1m in the afternoon with more
        fillers. Our showjumping shows offer a friendly competition environment,
        giving an encouraging experience to horse and rider. "
