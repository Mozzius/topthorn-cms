Topthorn Arena was established in 2009 and has been a firm favourite for East Anglian riders ever since.  When it changed ownership in 2018, the site was upgraded with new arena surfaces and a fresh rebranding for its new chapter. 

The site also houses a separate livery business, Millbank Livery, and is the home of the Newman family.

Topthorn was named after the original owner's grandfather's popular showjumping horse who was a WWI War Horse (one of the inspirations for Michael Morpurgo's Topthorn in his novel *War Horse*).
